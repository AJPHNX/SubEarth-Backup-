    Backstory:
        -A robot crash lands on earth and has to efficiently make sandwiches to survive
            Why:Efficiency powers its core
    Goal: 
        -Get throughh the lunch rush (sandwich cue) with the best time possible

    Objectives:
        -slice sandwiches with similar components at the same time
        for optimal efficiency 

     Obstacles:
        - You only have space to pre-load 8 sandwiches into your cue 
        - Switching between tasks (i.e. slicing like meats and cheeses) adds to time
        - You cam only fetch 2 loaves of bread per trip
        - Customers can have orders of random length causing you to have to re-ask 
        if it falls out of the temporary cue (for too long?)
            -if re-asked the the 

     Technique:
    
     Restrictions:

     *Additional language:
